# Information
When Missionchiefbot was shut down in January, a group of users came together to try and revive it. That attempt failed due to misappropriation of funds.  This version we now offer is now free of that issue!.  The group of people behind this version are all previous admins of the original version!  Subscriptions help us develop new features and retain our programmers who take our ideas and put them into use.
